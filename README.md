# nix-xdm

A nix derivation for [Xtreme Download Manager](https://github.com/subhra74/xdm) 

## Usage

As of now this derivation has not been published on any repository. You'll need to pull the derivation and add it to your configuration like so:

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }:

let
  # Remember to update the hash when the version changes
  # nix flake prefetch --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' --json github:Diomeh/nix-xdm/<VERSION>
  xdm = pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {
    owner = "Diomeh";
    repo = "nix-xdm";
    rev = "0.0.1";
    hash = "sha256-uME0V2thw0ANiqAgFHnSlPWG7Lg3iR1QLkcsFdQ0bT8=";
  };
in
{
  environment.systemPackages = [
    (pkgs.callPackage "${xdm}/derivation.nix" { inherit pkgs; })
  ];
}
```

Then rebuild your system derivation

```sh
sudo nixos-rebuild switch
```

From then onward `xdman` will be available for your system

### Running locally

You can build it locally by running the following command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Diomeh/nix-xdm.git
cd nix-xdm
nix-build
```

The derivation will be built and the output will be in the `result` symlink.

Then you can run the application by running:

```bash
./result/xdman
```
